## How to Run This Application (At the ROOT of the FOLDER)

Follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies for the client and server:

```
   npm run install:client
   npm run install:server
```

2. Start the application:

```
   npm run start
```

Once running, both the client and server will be available:

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the React app.\
Visit http://localhost:3001/testing to view the server app.\

Your task: Secure the application and make sure the JWT token is working as intended for both Frontend and backend.
